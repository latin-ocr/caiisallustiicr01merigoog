5. Corporis gaudiis] Cicero, de Fin. ii. 4, restricts
qaudium to mentsl pleasures, while voluptas, he says, may be
used either of mind or body. But as Epicurus aiiii-med, that even
the pleasures of the body were really referable to mental percep-
ίᾶἰῧιειε, he allows that, in this sense, the body can be said qaudere.

α. Magistratus et imperia] These who held maqsstra·
tus, scil. dictatore, consuls, praetors‚ censore, δια, elected by the

people at the comitia centuriata, had civil imperium of various
kinds in the city, and were said in imperio essm when any such

6. Patriam, aut parentes] Comp. Catil. 6. patriam pa-
rentesque armis tegere. Juqur. 87. armis patriam parentesque
tegi, where parentes cau only mean parents, or generally relatives.
But panum is- used sometimes for subjwcs, i. q. obedientes: as
J ny. 102. parentes abunde habemus, amicorum nunquam satis
fuit. Here the disjunctive aut marks au opposition between the
two objectu, and parentes may best be construed “ subjects.’'

7. Importunum est] ¹“Is inconvenient, injurious.'’
However much the usurpet may employ his power to reform

ahusen, still the revolution by which he has risen will engender
worse evils. These remarks are supposed to point to the usurpa- ”
