In the commencement of the Catilina Sallust
describes in general terms the profligacy of his con-
temporaries, and particularly of the class of candidates
for public office and distinction. The character of
the arch conspirator which he proceeds to draw is
represented as a natural'development of the licentious-
ness of the times, and the conspiracy itself appears to
be the legitimate fruit of the general abandonment
of prin'ciples, and prostration’ of public and private
virtues. But in order fully to understand it, we must
supply a serious omission on the historian’s part, and
give some account of the state of parties at Rome at
the moment of this frightfui explosion. The civil
wars of Marius and Sulla had been a contest between
the mass of the citizens marshalled by a few ambitious
nobleS, and headed by a fortunate soldier, and the
ruling class of senators and patricians, who main-
tained with tenacity the exclusive privileges assured
to them by an obsolete constitution. Their families
had been ennobled by public office, and enriched by
public service, and they strove to keep to themselves
the exclusive enjoyment of these advantages. This
class however had suffered a, severe defeat in the
admission of the Italians to the Roman franchise,
which, after a sanguinat-y war, though successful in
‘ the field, they had been constrained eventually to

concede. Marius at the head of the popular party
had humbled them by the successive acquisition of no

less than seven consulships. They had invoked the aid
of their military champion Sulla. A bloody civil war
