Hither Spain, with the super’ rank of propraetor, ordinarily
given only to such as had eerved the praetorship at home. But,
, as Sallust insinuates, the Senate stretched a point in order to get
quit of a dangerous enemy. . Comp. Suet. Jul. 9. ssisoni ob

are equivalent to the substantives propraetor, proconsul. Some
of the provinces were praetorian, others consular3 the latter were
for the most part frontier provinces, or such as required large
armies for their defence 3 e. g. the two Gauls, Syria, Cilicia, and
Macedonia. On the other hand, Asia, Achaia, Bithynia, and
the three provinces of Spain, were praetorian.

3· Infestum inimicum] “A bitter persona-l enemy.”
rho former word. is omitted in several MSS. as apparently re·

4. Simul] Sallust frequently uses this copulative to con·
nect a second less important reason with the principal reason
already given. Comp. Catil. 16, 17, 20, 56, and ,Ταριιτπι 4. cujue

provincialibus facit, occisus est. Sallust’s insinuation against

ompeius is not credible3 he had not sufficient motuve, besides
being far absent and occupied with other affairs. If there was

{ny 1ἓοῐιιθεῦἰο treachery, it lies at the door of the Senatorial party

7. Iter faciens] “On a march ;'’ not, on his way into
the country, where he had already arrived, as appears from Dion
