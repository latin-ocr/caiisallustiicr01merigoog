NOTES. 95

11. Mannum mercede] “With the wages of manual
labour.’' Gomp. Virg. AEn. viii. 409. Cui tolerare colo vitam

tenuique Minerva.

12· Privatis atque publicis largitionibus] ie· distri-
butione of corn, 011, or wine, made by rich patrous to their
clients3 or by candidates for office, or actual magistrates, to the
people. Thus Crassus, after the defeat of Spartacus, when suing-
for the consulship, Am. 683, feasted the Roman people at n
thousand tables. Public largesses had been given occasiona ,
and Ο. Gracchus introduced the sale of corn at low fixed prices to
the cifisens3 but M. Cato first advised a regular gratuitous distri-
bution, in the hope of withdrawing the needy citizens from the
influence of the demagogues. The largess (five bushels, Sall. Fr.
Hise.) was given monthly, Suet. Oct. 40.

13· Praetulerat.l Depending upon quae, ⁸⁸ toleraverat.

¹4· Eos] Scil. jwvenoe, understood in juventus: the oon·
struction is broken, juventus being a nomin. absolute.

15.] J uxta] “Not more for the advantage of the one than
the other, but equally ill for both.’' Comp. Catil. 61. ita cuncti
suae atque hostium vitae juxta pepercerant.

16. J us libertatis imminutum] “Treui-‚ed ⁸⁸ if they were
neither citizens nor freemen‚”‚i.e. deprived of the privileges of the

constitution. The families of the proscribed were incapacitated
for holding public office by a Lex Cornelia, AM. 673. Veli. ii. 28,
exclusique paternis opibus liberi etiam petendorum honorum jure
prohiberentur, simulque quod indignissimum est, senatorum filii
et onera ordinis sustinerent et jura perderent. The rehabilitation
of these persons was agitated for many years; defeated by Cicero
in his consulship; and at last effected by Caesar as dictator. See
Plutarch, Ooes. 37 (A. U. 705); Suet. Jul. 75.

17· Aliarum atque senati] Atqae and ac are used after
words of comparison, e. g. ulem, pars, εινςρίἰὶε, alius, oeque, per·
inde, aliter, smus,- where the sense can only be rendered in
English by “aa'' or “tham” Ut, however, sometimes occurs
with atque, as Cic. ὑπ Verr. i. 46. aliter atque ut edixerat3 from
which it may be surmised that the copula of comparison has
dropped out of the idiom; and that atque had originally its
proper sense of “immediately,” “just;'' e. g hio facit adem atque
(quod) eqo, ‘⁶ he does just the same as 1 do.’

18. Id adeo malum] Emphatic, “that evil, then;’' or
“that evil, great as it was :” namely, the inveterate jealousy of

the commons towards the senate, dating at least from the times
of the Gracchi, sixty or seventy years before.
