116 SALLUSTII JUGURTHA„

9. ForetJ “ Were already :’' the imperf. for the plusq.
perf. implying the immediateness of the act. Oomp. nearly the
same words in Tacitus, Anu. xii. 16.

· 10. Vineis.] These were wooden frames, covered with
hides, wattles, dcc„ to protect the besiegers, while they worked
their battering rams, or constructed their towers. Vinea is pro·
perly an adjective, agreeing with porticus, (as appears from Gaes.
Bell. civ. ii. α. porticus integebantur), from its similarity to vines
trained over trellis-work.

11. Tempus...antecapere.] “To make the best use of
the time before their return.''

η. Velle et censere] Velle is said of a resolution of the
people, censere of the senate.

colles clementer assurgentes.

3. Malitia] “ Vice.” The same opposition is found in
Seneca, Epist. 106. quicquid agimus aut malitiae aut virtutis
gerimus imperio. Cicero indeed, Taso. disp. iv. 15, oppones
vitiositas to virm, and would confine malitia to a particular
quality, as we say, “medice-’² But in another place, de Nat.
Deor. iii. 30, he says that malitia is any versuta et fallax nocendi
ratio.

4. ο Ob easdem artes] “For the same qualities which
γ had gained him the favour of Scipio.’'

5. Pro bona] i. q. simpl. bene. Kritz, pro ὀοπο faeere,
i. q. facere ita sicut bonum est, i. e. ut probari potest. Dietsch.

6. Ab jnre... rohibuerit.] “prevent hia using the 1³⁸¹
of nations to defen or avenge himself.’'

OHAPTER XXIII.

rutione defendunt-ur. Dietsch.
