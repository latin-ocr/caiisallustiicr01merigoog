N OTES. 105

CHAPTER XII.

1· Loca ropinqua thesauris] ἰ. e· the citios or fortified
places in whio the royal ,treasures were deposited, or which
seem-ed the command cf them. No such place as Thirmida is

known. Hippo (tile modern Bona) and Cirta (Constantina) were
the principal cities of Numidia.

2. Proximus lictor] The lictors walked before the magis- γ
trates at Rome, and the last of these, who immediately preceded

the magistrate, was therefore proximus to him. The Roman
writers constantly apply their own terms to foreign officere, &at

lictor means here, “an attendant.'’ Prooeimus, here metaphori-
canly, “most confidential.”

3. Onerat] Oomp. Liv. xxiv. 13. Hannibal oneratos in-
gentibus promissis domum redire jubet.

4. Refessebantur.] “Were regularly carried back to

Hiempsal;” 1. e. whenever they had been used to unloek the
treasury for the public service.

5. Ut doctus erat] “As he was instructed:” the simplest
but least usual sense of the participle, which generally means,
peritas, eruditus.

'6. Diversi] “Going different ways.”

7. Mulieris ancillae.] Mulier is superfluous, asin many
places. Ter. Andr. iv. 4. 16. mulier meretrix. Phormio, ii. 1.
62. homo servus. Cic. ad Div. vii. 22. homo gladiator. We
say, “‘a maid servant‚” “a waiting woman,·'’ but in Latin the

sex is igcidicated by the form of the qualifying word, aneilla,
servus, o.

CHAPTER XIII.

1. Voluntatffl] “Of their own good will.” Comp. Liv.
Epic. ⁸xlix. Andriscus totam Macedoniam aut voluntate incolen-

tium aut armis occupavit. Observe that the ablativos vi, volumtate,

refer to different subjecte, though brought under the same eon-
struetion to serve the antithesis.

α. In provinciam,] i. e. the Roman province of Africa3
formerly the domain of Carthage. The simple term provincia
was applied to it, κατ’ ἐξοχήν, as also to the possessions of the
republio in Gaul. Comp. Juqur. 25, 39, 62.
