1. Preti] “ Relying ou the bribes they had given rather
than on the merits of their case.”

α. Putarent,] scil. the senators, understood in senatus.
Drakenborch on Liv. iv. 58, brings together a great many similar
instances of the plural verb after senatus.

3· Ante facta sua onerent] Ante, signifying “pre-
ference‚” never separated rom its verb in Cicero, but commonly

iu the later writers. See Hand, Tursell. i. 386, aud so in Ennius,

gaulottzd by Cicero, Off. i. 24. Non ponebat enim rumores ante

thence ιο Dertona. Strab. ν. He was consul, Β.ο. 107, censor,
and afterwards princeps senatus. He was a staunch champion of
the senate3 nevertheless he was accused by Varius, a tribune of

Prortddlyf ssmffnded {f the ¹‘ziieople vghgther the{hwould takes, ἷξε
wo o artus‚a ama ‚ oro caurus, e rmceo e
senate; and this appeEl was answered with aocJamafions. Cicero

· extols the character of Scaurus, as a champion of the nobility.

For the same reason probably Sallust seeks to depreciate him.
