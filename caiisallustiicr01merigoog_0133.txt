ι Ad bellum maritimum ata? ue Mithridaticum-l

'Phe‘ ‘maritime war’ ’was thataga e Cilician pirates, who
infested the whole of the Mediterranean, and often made descents
ou land, even in Italy. Gabinius, a creature of Pompey, pro·
posed a law for conferring upon him exn-aordinary command for
their suppression, 4. U. 687. The speed and efficiency with
which Pom pey put down these marauders was deservedly cele-
brated. ·See Cic. pro leq. Manil. ια, Plutarch, Pomp. 24, and
the historians Appian, Florus, and Ve’lleius Patet-culus.

The‘ ‘Mithridatio war” was the long contest waged hythe
rep ublic against Mithridates, the renowned king of Pontus,
Sulla had defeated, and was supposed to have crushed him; but
he rose again, and wrested the province of Asia from the Romans.
Lucullus again defeated him, but he was still unconquered; and
at last, at the motion of Manilius, the Roman people appointed
Pompey te carry on the war against him, with full powers
throughout the eastern possessions of the republic. Thispo extra-
ordinary commission was regarded by the senate with great
jealousy. It was apprehended that Pompey would never consent
to return to Rome as a private man. Nevertheless, after the
¹successful completion of his task, and the addition of extensive

repented, and tried, by a league with Oaesar and Crassus, (the
first triumvirate,) to acquire a more decided supremacy in the
commonwealth. The Manilian law was carried 4. u. 688.
