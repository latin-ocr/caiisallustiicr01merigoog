xxviii I N TROD UG'TION. ⁴

crisis of the civil wars which was soon about to be
developed The early career of Marius and Sulla,
their selfish ambition and personal antagonism, serve .
as a preface to the recol-ds of slaughter and proscrip-
tion with which their names were to become con-
spicuously blended. J ugurtha himself, the crasty Ἴ
Numidiam, bold and active, with inexhaustible re- , }
sources and devoid of scrupleS, combining the subtilty ’
of the Carthaginian with the ferocity of the Moor‚ is ⁸
interesting not only on his own accomt, but as a type ’
of the African characizer, such as it was afterwards
exemplified in TacfarinaS, and recently in Abd-el-
kadcr. The struggle of the serpent and the eagle‚ so
favourite a subject with poets and painters, has been
delineated by no historian more vividly than by Sallust. „
