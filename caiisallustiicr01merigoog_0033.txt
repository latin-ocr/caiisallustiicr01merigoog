IN TROD U OTION. xxv

cannot doubt the general correctness of the charges
against Catilina. Oould they have been fairly ques-
tioned, we must suppose that Sallust, as a bitter enemy
of his adversaries, would not have failed to suggest
some extenuation of them. On the whole Sallust’s

He is accused of undervaluing Cicero's merit. It is

open to difference of opinion. It is not unreasonable,
however, to believe that Cicero’s influence has been
generally overrated. The nobles had been long aware
of the imminence of such an outbreak as that of
