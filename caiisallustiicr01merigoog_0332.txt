sternation of the Romans.

grande et atrox spectaculum, etc.

ι.. Post diem quintum quam-l An anomalum σοι·
structton for dte quinto post quam.

α. Rex Bocche] This commencement of a mech with
the name of the person addressed, and the prefix of “kingss'
neither oi which are usual, imply peculiar respectfulness.

3. Persequi] More properly persequendi ,· but the infin.
follows ,the idea of non coqem, implied in deuteres amandino».

4. Inopi] Ι enclose this word in brackets. If it agree
with populo, it must mean that the Romans had continued feeble
from the first: if with principio, it should be written inope, and
transposed, ab inope principio. But it is supported by the MSS.
generally. Imperi, written perhaps impi, is a plausible conjec-
ture.

ψ, 5· Offensae minimum, gratia par] “.1¹i¹⁵¹⁵!0 oppertu-
n1ty for quarrelling, and as much favour and estimation, as 11 we

were your near neighbours.”

⁷· cui scilicet placuisse-J “ whom 1¹⁵ had plm’·
The infin. governed by scilicet, i.e. scire licet.- as Juqur. 113.

8. Pro delicto suo] “ In excuse for his fault. ”

· do· Unde vi J ugurtham effulerit] Many MSS· md
Ed read expulerat. Bocchus h not expelled J ugurtha from

any part of his dominions3 but this latter reading would make
the author essert the fact. Reputo-it may imply that Bocchus
made the assei-tion, which was a false one. Translate: “A part
of Numidia, says he, from which he pretends to have expelled
J ugurtha, had become his own by the right of conquest.” Ciac-
conius conjectured, ci inde Romanos apuleo-it: and other correc-
tions have been proposed: but there seems to be no satisfactory
way of explaining the passage.
