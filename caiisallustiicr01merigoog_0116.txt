1. Nihilo minus] “Having thns'made his preparatione*
for seizing power by force, if necessary, Catiline, althouff re·
pulsed in his previous attempt, nevertheless sued again for the
consulship of the year following,'' i. e. of the year 69². Kritz.
Or, “although he had made preparatione for seizing power,
nevertheless he sued for the next year’s consulship in the legiti-
mate way‘:” Gerlach and otherst whicli gives a simpler meaning,
If he became consul-designate, he expected to have much in-
fluence with one of the actual consuls, viz. Antonius3 for the‘

4· Pactione provinciae.] The consuls generally chose by ‚·
lot between the provinces of the Cisalpine Gaul and Macedonia.
The former was important from its proximity to the city, but the
latter more attractive from its greater extent and wealth. Cicero,
having obtained Macedonia, transferred it to his colleague‚ which?
was considered an act of great generosity. But Cicero did not*
intend to take a province at all: he preferred remaining in the=
city, where his engagemeuts as an advocate ensured him riches'
