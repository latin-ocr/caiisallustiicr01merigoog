mod. the guli of Sidra, aud the guli of Kh2=bs2 deep bays in the

northern ooast of Africa, 111 which the tide has some influenee.
They are obstrue-ted with shifting saud-banks, aeoumulsted by
the currente of the outer sea, some of which are unoovered st
low water. Sallust derives their name, in accordanee with the
ideas of the Greek geographers, from the verb σύρειν, “ to drag,”
from the stones, 810. dragged along the bottom by the soree of the
waves. But the words Syrtes ab tractu nominatae found 111 most

who says, referring to this passage, nomen a re inditum, Syrtes
Sallustius a tractu vocari dicit. Sallust describes the Syrtes ss
having deep water near the land, but shallow from the saud-baula
