CHAPTER XXX.

1. Arma portari] Gaius distinguishes ferre, portare and
affere: Ferri proprie dicimus quae quis suo corpore bajulat, portari
ea quae quis in jumento secum ducit, agi ea quae animalia sunt}

- portare is also emphatic or poetic for ferre.

8. calumnia] “ Machination, cabal‚” from an old word
