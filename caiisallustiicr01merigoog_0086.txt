50 SALL USTJI CATILINA.

on.

7. UtimurJ Uti generally in a good sense, to employ to a
good purpose, to enjoy the use of. Here the verb belongs
strictly to imperio only, but governs servitio also indirectly by
the figure zeugma: i. e. “we enjoy the government of the soul,
but suffer the servitude of the body.’'

8. Quo mihi rectius videtur] “Wherefore it seems 1²0
me the more right.'’ Comp. eo profusius, c. 14.

fluctuate. See Spengel on ¹Varro, de anua Lat. p. 10. In
this edition the, double ’ἰῇ is preserved throughout, as the usual

form.

ιο, Opibus] ‘⁴ Resources.’' Vnt-es semper apud Sall. sunt
corporis vires. Fabrius.

11. Maxime] Caesar wrote mamimus, optimus. Quintil.
Inst. i. 7. Before him they were written u for ἐς but not always :
maximos is found in the inscription of the Duilian column. In
this edition the form in i is retained.

12. Nam divitiarum] Compare Sallust, Juyur. 2 igitur
praeclara facies, magnae divitiae, ad hoc vis corporis et alia hujus-

modi omnia alicui dilabuntur5 at ingenii egregia facinora, sicuti
anima, immortalia sunt. Of. Tac. Ayric. 4 .

13. Fluxa] “Fleeting,’⁷ “fading-;” fluidus, that which
fleets or fiows naturally3 fluxas, that which becomes so by cor-
ruption or degeneracy, therefore generally of artificial things:
but this distinction is not uniformly preserved. Here translate
‘⁴ fading,” or ‘⁴ evanescent,'’ as opposed to clara. “ Beauty fades
and deoays, virtue shines and endures.” ἐ

14. Habetur.] “Is esteemed,” implying men’s opinion ἶ

of it : here possibly in its more proper sense: “virtue is a noble Ἴ
and eternal 'possessiom'' Sallust very often gives this force to ἵ

the active, as: J ηραν. 94. toto die intentos praelio Numidas
habuerat. Dietsch.

15. Inter mortales] More emphatic, as being more nni-
gfflxgliiassgzzomineu as we say mnkind for m. Comp. A.
