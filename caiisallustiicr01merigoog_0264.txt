L· AEmilius Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia, who became
known as P. Cornelius Scipio AEmilianus Africanus minor, more
commonly called Scipio AEmilianus. He was the conqueror of
Numantia in Spain (Am. 621), and opposed the agrarian laws of
Tiberius Gracchus. ·

7· Rei militaris facinora] i. q. militaria facinora. So
Cic. pro Mur. 10. rei militaris virtus.

8· Syphace] Syphax was a N umidian chief, who wal-red
with the Carthaginians about the year 540 of the city.' He
entered into alliance with the Romans, but afterwards betrayed
them, and connected himself with his former enemies. After
various rever-ses he was finally defeated by the Romans. Polybius

relates that he died in confinement previously. Silius Italicus
follows Livy's account, and represents the effiyy of the captive as
carried among others in the procession xvii. 630 ε

Ante Syphax, feretro residem, captiva premebat

Lumina, et auratas servabant colla catenae

- Mox victas tendens Carthago ad sidera palmas
Ibat, et effigies orae Jam lenis Iberae.

9. Magnum atque late] Both words are to be taken
adverbially. Comp. Virg. G. iii. 28. magnumque fluentem Nilum.

Tac. Amll vi. 37. nuntiavere accolae Euphratem sponte et immen-
sum atto i.

.10. Bona atque honesta] “Good and true.”

sway ceased only with his death.” At his d'ecease the grants

made him by the Romans reverted to the republic, and his son
, Micipsa retained authority only in his patrimonial possessione.

of contemptuous abandonment.

1. Luxu,] The dat. case. This use of u for ui is confined,
according to Priscian, vii 18, to poetry; and adopted for the
convenience of metre. Julius Oaesar, however, according to
Gellius, N. A. iv. 16, considered it the true form of the termi-
nzition. In the MSS. of Sallust it occurs frequently, but not
a ways. ’
