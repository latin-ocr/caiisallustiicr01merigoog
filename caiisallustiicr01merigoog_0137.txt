is generally used technically of legal proceedings. It was the
policy of the conspirators to pretend that Cicero had got up
a false rumour of a plot in order to drive innocent men away
from the city. Comp. Appian. Bell. Giv. ii. 3. Λεύκων δὲ Βηστίαν

4. Optimo consuli] It seems that M. Brutus in writing
an account of these transactione used this same expression, opti·

mus comul, with reference to Cicero’s part in them. Cicero in a
letter to Atticus, xii. 21,‚complains of the account as calculated
to exalt Cato's conduct in comparison with his own, and refers to
this phme as dis aging. Hic autem se etiam tribuere multum
mihi putat, qu scripserit optimum consulem. Itis probable,
from the character of his mind, that Brutus was very cold and
measured in his laudation of the consul, and in his mouth the
word optimus might have a formal and pedantic sound. But 1 do
not think Sallust meantanything depreciatory. Optimus was
itself a hearty and genial word, and occurs in the most compli-
mentary descriptions. Juvenal, x. 331. Optimus hic et formo·
sissimus idem Gentis patricioe. Cicero himself uses it of Pansa3
consul fortissimus atque optimus. Philipp. vii. α.

one of the Saturnalia, which commenced with the 17th of Decem-
ber. The tribunes were to enter upon their office the xoth of that

mouth. But Cicero’s ilance anticipated this dessign, He got

when he says that the conspirators assigned a hundred different
places to be fired at the same time.

young men. Cicero calls them, libidinosa et delicata juventus
(ad Aa. i. 19); sanguinaria juventus (ad Aa. ii. 7). Comp. in
