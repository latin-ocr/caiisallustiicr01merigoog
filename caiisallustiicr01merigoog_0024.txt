therefore is the first Roman historian whose account
of these times became generally accepted by his own

probably quite as much to the charm of his style, as to

any presumed authenticity in his narration. Indeed ¹
he seems to have been the first of the Roman writers ¹

who made style a matter of primary importance. The
idea however that he took Thucydides for his model,

rests upon the occurrence of a few philosophical re-
flexions, which seem to be directly imitated from the

Greek writer. In the mere form of Sallust’s expres· ,
siens it would be difficult to point out any such ⁷

resemblances to his supposed master. Seneca speaks
correctly of his <anputatae sententiae et verba ante ex-

 

spectatum cadentia. The charge against him of affect-

ing archaic words was made by his own contemporaries.
LenaeuS, above spoken of, calls him priscorum Catonis-

Ateius the grammarian, was supposed to have assisted
the historian by collecting· antique words for him to

I cannot however distinguish any such· character
in Sallust's extant writings. In the Catilina and
J uqurtha there is not, 1 believe, a single word used
which is not also of frequent occurrence in contem-
porary and later writers. It is probable indeed that
he clung to the old orthography of many words at a
time when great innovations in that respect were
