=Christian apologists* pointed with triumph to this horrid rite.
Minucius, Octav. 30. et quod Saturni filio dignum est...ipsum
credo docuisse sanguinis foedere conjurare Catilinam. Cicero may
possibly allude to it in Catil. 1. sica, quae quidem quibus abs te
initiata saeris et devota sit...; but Sallust himself insinuates that
it was at least unknown to Cicero. Perhaps it was a single drop

‘of blood mixed in a bowl of wine to preserve the shadow of an
antique ceremoniaL·

Dietsch and others, after the common reading, which however
seems impossible. The MSS. vary, e. g. dictante, dictare, dicti·

Oicer0,” when he was afterw accused by the tribune Clodius
of getting Roman citizens punished with death without an appeal
to the people. For this sense of the word comp. c. 6. invidia ex
opulentia orta est3 and c. 23. nobilitas invidia (Ciceronis)
aestuabat. Cicero himself thus defines it (Tusa. Βίῳ. iv. 7. 16>
invidi-ia non in eo qui invidet solum dicitur, sed etiam in eo cui
invi etur.

infamy,” or “with ridicule ;” the Romans applied the metaphor
to the deeds themselves, as Cic. in Ver. i. 4. sceleribus cooper-
