110 ‚ SALLUSTH JUGURTHA.

CHAPTER XVI.

1· Pretium aut gratiam] ‘⁴ Bribery οι· influenoe.”

L imina] A champion of the optimates, and vehe-
ment zoppongit of the Agrarian lawe of the Gracchi. He was
consul Β. ο. 121, in which capacity the senate called upon him to
see‘ ‘ne quid res publica detrimenti caperetss’ This decree was
called Senatus· consultum ultimum, and was interpreted by the
nobles as investing the consul with plenary authority over the
lives of the citizens. Accordingly Opimius caused O. Gracchus,
and his colleague ιιι the tribunate, Fulvius Flaccus, to be seiaed‚
as public enemies, and put to death. The plebs denied the right
to put any citizen to death except by a vote of the peopgle.
Opimius was eventually condemned by a popular vote for taking
bribee of J ugurtha, and driven into banishment. Cicero extols
him as the saviour of the commonwealth.

3. Victoriam] Opimius followed up the slaughter of
Gracchus by the massacre of three thousand of his partizans
in the city. Plut. G. fflNJacch Victoriam exercere, istoexercise

the rights of victory. So' m Catil. 38.

4. In inimicia] Ι adopt the reading of Kritz and severa-l
other editors, for amicis, given by the MSS.

5. Amantissimo] “ With elaborate attention. ” Aecu-
ratus is said of things, diliqe‘ns of persons.

6. Fama, fide] The ablat. governed by the comparative
force of anteferrent, “he considered the advantage of the king
more important than his own reputation.” So Cic. pro Balb- 8.
quum magna pars libertatem civitate anteferret3 i. e. potiorem
duceret. Cic. Orat. 13. Isocrates videtur testimonio Platonis
aliorum Judicia debere contemnere, · i. e. minoris facere.

7. Eadem via] “By the same means, ” This meta·
phorical use of via is common in Sallust. Comp. Catil. ιι. vera.
via. Juywr. 1. virtutis via.

8. Mauretaniam] The north-western parts of Africa,
modern Fez and Marocco. At this period the river Mulucha,

. now Mulviah, constituted the boundary of Mauretania and

N umidia.. The name more correctly written with e than with
i, as appears from inscriptions, and so aleo in some of our MSS.
in this place. Dietsch.

9· Agre] ‘⁸ In extent of territory ’⁹

ιο. Illam alteram] “That other well· ‘known part.'’
Comp. Cic. in Catil. iv. 5. si eritis secuti sententiam C. Gaesaris,

fortasse minue erunt mihi populares impetus pertimescendi3 sin
illam alteram (that other which you have heard), nescio an, etc.
