88 SALL USTII CATILINA.

16. Inquilinus civis] From incolo, “ a sojourner in a
city ;'' as a ludger in a house, one who has no rights of possession.
This is an unjust sarcasm on Cicero, who was a genuine citizen of
Rom03 but the proud patrician sneers at the plebeiam generally,
as an adventitious class.

17. ParricidamJ “Unnatural murderer.” This epithet
is applied ιο any monstrous criminal: as Catil. 14. omues un-
dique parricidae, sacrilegi, convicti judiciis. But more particu-
larly to traitors against the state, slayers of their country. Cic.
in Cata. i. 7. Te patria odit ac metuit, ac jam diu te nihil judi-
cat nisi de parricidio suo cogitare. Oomp. Tac. Hist. i. 85.
Hostem et parricidam Vitellium vocantes.

18. Ruina, restinguam] Just as a conflagration may be
extinguished by the falling or pulling down of the house. Cicero,

pro Murena, 25, cites the same phrase as used by Gatiliue: quum
Catoni respondisset si quod esset in suas fortunas incendium ex·
citatum, id se non aqua sed ruina restincturum. This reply,
according to Cicero, was made not ιο himself} but ιο Cato, who
probably had followed him in the debate.
