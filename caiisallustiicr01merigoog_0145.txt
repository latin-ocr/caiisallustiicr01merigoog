10- Referendum censuerat] He had proposed that the
question of punishment should stand over for the present, pro-

bably till the issue of the contest with Catilina 3 the culprits being
kept in custody during the interval: praesidis addatis, “ guards
'placed over them.”

11· 'ubi ad eum ventum] There was much irregularity

in the order inwhich ο iniens were demanded in the senate. The .

consul (or⁴ praetor in ’ absence) who summoned the meeting,
called upon all the member· separately ιο declar-e their senti-
menta, which they did either in a speech, or by merely assenting
ιο the opinion of some preceding speaker3 in which case they
rose from their place, and went over ιο him. At the conclusion
of the debete, the groups thus assembled were counted. Comp.
Plin. Ep. viii. 14. ¹9· lex aperte jubet dirimi debere sententias
occidentis et relegantis, cum ita discessionem fieri jubet3 qui
hoec sentitis in hanc partem, qui alia omnia in illam partem ite,
qua sentitis...i.e. in eam in qua sedet qui censuit relegandos.
The consul usually called first upon one of the consuls designate,
‚next upon the consulare, the praetors, and other high magistrates.
But he was not bound to any particular order3 and in the pre-
sent case we find Catulus, a consular, speaking after Caesar, who
was praetor-designate. But whatever order the consul assigned
at the commencement of his term of office, he was expected to
maintain throughout. Caesar’s violating this usage, in his own
consulship, was remarked upon. See Suet. Jul. 21. post novam
affinitatem, Pompeium primum rogare sententiam coepit, >‘cum
Crassum soleret3 essetque consuetudo, 'ut quem ordinem inter·
rogandi sententias consul kalendis januariis instituisset, eum toto
anno conservaret. On this occasion it seems that Crassus was
not present, otherwise Sallust, or Cicero himself, would undoubt-
edly have recorded his opinion. He w'as indignant, perhaps, at
> the suspicion of complicity cast upon him. Many of the senators
abstained from attending, from various motivas. Comp. Cic. in
Catil. iv. 5 3 adAtt. xii. 21.
