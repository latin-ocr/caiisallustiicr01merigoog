66 SALL USTII CATILINA. η

4. Gratuita] ‘⁶ Wantonly,” i. e. with no immediate motivo
or temptation: hence, “in vain‚” “to no purpose:’' Liv. i. 47.
jam enim a scelere ad aliud spectare mulier scelus...ac gratuita
praeterita parricidia essent. For the sentiment compare Cic. de
Off. ii. 24„ of Caesar, ut hoe ipsum eum delectaret, peecare, etiam
si causa non esset.

ιε 5· Quod ωε alienum per omnes terras ingens erat]
Because in every country t ere were men deeply 1n debt3 and

therefore interested in the success of a social revolution.

6. Sullani milites] The veterane of Sulla’s legions,
many thousands of whom he had settled in colo'nies throughout
Italy. These fortunate soldiers soon squandered the produce
of their estates, contracted debts, and having no habits of

eful industry‚ only looked to new comotione to retrieve
themselves. Comp. Catil. 37. and Cic. in Catil. ii. 9. in tantum
ωε alienum inciderunt, ut si salvi esse velint Sulla sit iis ab inferis

excitandus.

7. In Italia] The republic never maintained a standing
army in Italy: its legions were all occupied in the provinces.
The police of Rome and the large towns was kept by the citizens
themselves, and the consuls and chief magistrates had only a few

lictors and archers in attendance upon them.

8. In· extr. terris] Pompey was engaged, under the pro- -
visions of the Manilian bill, which gave him proconsular power

“ over all the provinces of the east, in subduing Mithridates, king
of Pontus, and in orden-ing the affairs of the eastern frontier.
Comp. Lucan, iv, 1. At procul extremis terrarum Oaesar in oris,

i. e. Spain. “ ,

9. Consulatum egenti] Catiline first stood for the
consulship Am. 688. ing thwarted in this attempt he still

hoped to suoceed at a subsequent opportunityz his suit for the
consulship is therefore spoken of as still proceeding.

10. Nihil] “*In no respect at all:'' more emphatic than
the simple non.
