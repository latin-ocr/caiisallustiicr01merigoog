NOTES. 169

2· Ex castris abire] Comp. 35. Massiva profugus ex
castris abierat. 68. Metellus...e conspectu abit.

3. ⁸ Haberet...ejus,] Illum referring to Jugurtha: patre
suo, his (Volux's) father, Bocchus ; ipse filius, Volux himself.

4· Ea rea, ut in tali negotio, probata] “This
course, considering there was no better under the circumstances,

was approved.” Comp. Cic. ad Div. xii. α. nonnihil, ut in tantis·
malis, est profectum ε de Senect. 4. multae erant in Q. Fabio, ut
in homine Romano, literae.

CHAPTER CVIII.

1. Orator] i. q. leyatus, as frequently in Livy. Comp. i.
153 ii. ‚¹..33 v. 153 xxxii. 173 xxxvii. 24, ἀπο. Virg. AEn. vii.
1533 vm. 5053 xi. 100. 33¹· ·

2. Consulta...integra habere] “That he had preserved
inviolate the covenant existing between them.'’

3· Neu Jugurthae legatum pertimesceret quo res ·

communis licentius gereretur] mentius, ¹· q. ciamus,
“that Sulla should not, through distrust of J ugurtba's envoy,

Aspar, who was to be present, refrain from a free discussion
with Dabar about the affairs between himself and Bocchus.” If
this is the meaning, we should expect quin or ne instead of quo.
But it would be difficult to connect this sense with what follows.
Kritz's conjecture, remoto after quo, gives the contrary sense, and
a much better one. Another conjectural reading is, n. J. l. p. .-
cautum esse quc, etc. In any case the passage seems corrupt.

4. Punica fide] “With Carthaginian bad faitb,'' a pro·
verbial expression applied to the Moors and N umidians as well
as to the actual Carthaginians. Comp. Lucan, iv. 736. ‘Ut
Libycas metuat fraudes infectaque semper Punica bella dolis.
For the proverbial bad saith attributed by the Romans to the
Carthaginians‚ see Livy, xxi. 4 ; xxv. 393 xlii. 475 Flor. ii. 2. 63
Val. Max. vii. 4. 4, etc. Plautus has the phrase, Poenis Poenior.
On the other hand, Attica fides was an expression for good saith,
Ven. ii. 2 3. adeo enim certa Atheniensium in Romanos fides
fuit ut semper, et in omni re, quicquid sincera fide ageretur, id
Romani Attica fieri praedicarent. Ausonius, Epist. x. 47, con·
trasts Poma with Graeca fides. Comp. Erasm. Δάας. viii. 27, 28.

5. Attinuisse.] “ Kept in play, amused or engaged.'’
Attinere is commonly used in a moral sense. So Sallust, Fraq. „.

Hice. i. ¹9· ne nos m solitudine attineas. But by Tacitus fre·
quently for forcible detention ε e. g. attineri in custodia.
