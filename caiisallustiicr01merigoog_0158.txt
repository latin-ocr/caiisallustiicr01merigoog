CHAPTER LIX.

¹. Signa canere jubet.] “ Orders the trumpets to sound.'’
I understand siqua however as the object, subaud. tubicines the

subject, as in [ηραν. 29. Marius jubelz tubicines simul omnes
signa canere. But this subject and obJ'ect are rarely expressed
together. We have Liv. xxiv. 46. cornicines canere jubent. Sall.
Fr. Eia. i. 38. cornicines occinuerunt. But it is more common
to meet wit-h the phrase in the text. Comp. Liv. i. ις xxiv. ¹5 ;
xxvii. 47. Some critics take siqua as the subject, in which case
the idiom is identical with izhe English given above.

2. Omnium equis] Comp. Caes. Β. Θ. ἰ. 25. caeear
primum suo deinde omnium e conspectu remotis equis, ut aequsto

7· Faesulanum quemdam] Plutarch gives him the

8. Curare] “To commsnd;” s proper military term.

9· Libertis et colonis] “His own froedmen and the
Sullsn veternus setlzled in colonies ε ” a chosen bsud,of men
