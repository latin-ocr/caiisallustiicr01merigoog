affl} marianS, and their reading of them 18 of course entitled

ms to careful consideration.

The ‘text given by Gerlach in 1118 last edition, Ber·-

ξ· 1111, 1852, very nearly correspondS, at laet, after much
fluctuation of opinion, with that of Kritz, Leipsic‚
1828—1834, and, with the exceptione indicated above,

adopted for the convenience of the young reader‚ Ι

either with one or the other of these eminent critice. ff

. gross expression 3 a course which for my own part

Ι could wish to see more extensively adopted in an

,Ἴ age when the reading of· Latin 18 becoming almost as
common among women of polished education as in the

good old times of J ane Grey and Elizabeth.

5. Much novelty of illustration 18 hardly to be‘ expected

,Ι upon a subject which has been 80 repeatedly treated,
and most of the editore have done little more ’111 this
respect than copy from one another. The edition of
Kritz, however, which is mainly devoted to an exami-
nation of the author's grammatical constructione, 18
distinguished by great originality of research. I have
appended his name only to a few of the notes ; but
my obligation to 1118 learning and acumen are mani*

, fold throughout. Some use has also been made of
the recent edition by Dietech‚ which hae only reached
me while these sheets were printing.
