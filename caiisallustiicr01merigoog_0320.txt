5. Illis dolentia] i. e. quae illi dolerent, or dolorem afferrent,
“causing pain.’' Oomp. Ovid, Met. iv. 246. nil illo fertur...vi·

6. Plerosque militiae, paucos fama cognitos-1 “Most
of them known to him in actual service, a few only by report :'’

statement, believing that pay was not given till a later period.

9. Plebi militia volenti] This dat. volenti is a Graecism.
